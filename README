CocoParticle is intended to be used by Cocos2d app developers who want to create particles for their apps.

Features / Todo:
* supports every particle system property of Cocos2d
* imports png files for use as the "particle"
* exports particles as an objective-c class in a .m file, inheriting from the Cocos2d particle system class

Right now the app is setup as a UISplitViewController where the left (small) pane is a native UIView where you manage the particles.
The main pane is a Cocos2d view where the particle is displayed.

I intend to use Dropbox to handle the importing & exporting of files. I haven't done any research to see if this is possible though.
